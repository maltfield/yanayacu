This topographical map was made to serve as a proper relief map at the Yanayacu Biological Research Station and surrounding area over the boarder of the Antisana National Park.

The page size of this map in inkscape is set to 1200 mm x 675 mm (16:9 letterbox ratio), and it was exported from Maperitive at zoom=18, but it should be able to be scaled-up as large as needed. All of the elements are vectors, except the bitmap of the hillshades (but I don't think a gradient shade bitmap is an issue scaling).

For example, if you want to print this map on a piece of paper that's four times larger than the page size (4.8 meters x 2.7 meters), you can just export a PNG from inkscape at 300 dpi * 4 = 1,200 DPI. That should suffice for the print shop.

The source for all files in this directory is the SVG vector image. This file was designed in Inkscape. Inkscape is free software that runs on all platforms. Viewing or editing this SVG in Adobe Illustrator or a web browser may mis-render some graphics or cause corruption. Don't do it. Use Inkscape.

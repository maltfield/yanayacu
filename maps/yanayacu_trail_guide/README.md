This trail guide was made to serve as a simple map of the trails at Yanayacu.

It is designed to be printed on single sheet of A4 paper (landscape), but it can be infinitely scaled-up to large (wall-mounted) maps.

This intentionally simplified map is not a substitute for a proper topographical map, which is why we have a QR code pointing the reader to download Organic Maps, which uses the Open Street Map data from which this map was derived. We chose Organic Maps because it's simple, free, geared towards hiking maps (eg has contour lines), and it can be used without data. Gaia is another option, but downloading offline maps requires the paid version.
